                Since Sri Lanka is a multi cultural country, you cannot expect anything less when it comes to Sri Lankan food. Offering a vivid array of flavor combinations,  Our country is filled with its regional flavours while the cuisine is known for a rich combination of rice specialities, spices, herbs, seafood, seasonal vegetables and fruits and of course, legumes. <br>

                <br> Culture plays a pivotal role in the food scene in Sri Lanka while many Sinhalese food items are derived from the chena cultivation. From the most celebrated and auspicious Sinhala and Hindu New Year to various day to day events and celebrations will see an array of traditional Sri Lankan meals ranging from milk rice, sweetmeats and spicy curries for accompaniments. <br>
                
                <br>Many of these dishes are centred around the main staple rice, rice flour and coconut while seafood also plays quite an important part in Sri Lankan cuisine. Most Sri Lankans prefer vegetable curries while the main go-to meal in any part of the island is the good old “Rice and Curry”. The curries have immense flavour and colours which are derived from a list of Sri Lankan Hot Spices. These spices not only add great flavour to the food but also adds ayurvedic value to the dish. <br>
                
                <br>Since Sri Lankan food is regionally diverse, you can expect the same dish prepared in various methods and with different flavours. For an example, the dishes from the South of Sri Lanka have a distinctive quality and is mainly amalgamated with seafood. “Ambulthiyal” is a unique spicy fish preparation that uses a thick gambooge (goraka) paste while the preparation in the South is different from the other parts of the island.<br>
                
                <br>Hot and Spicy, tangy and sweet are the main flavours that you can explore whenever you are on a food trail in Sri Lanka. <br>

                          <br>The elephant is the national animmal of Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan elephants are the largest subspecies reaching a shoulder height of between 2 and 3.5 m (6.6 and 11.5 ft), weigh between 2,000 and 5,500 kg (4,400 and 12,100 lb), and have 19 pairs of ribs.
                          Their skin colour is darker than of indicus and of sumatranus with larger and more distinct patches of depigmentation on ears, face, trunk and belly.
                          Only 7% of males bear tusks.
                          Longest tusks of 7 feet 6 inches long was found in Millangoda Raja (1938-30 July 2011)<br>
                          
                          <br>The Sri Lankan leopard has a tawny or rusty yellow coat with dark spots and close-set rosettes, which are smaller than in Indian leopards. Seven females measured in the early 20th century averaged a weight of 64 lb (29 kg) and had a mean head-to-body-length of 3 ft 5 in (1.04 m) with a 2 ft 6.5 in (77.5 cm) long tail, the largest being 3 ft 9 in (1.14 m) with a 2 ft 9 in (84 cm) long tail; 11 males averaged 124 lb (56 kg), the largest being 170 lb (77 kg), and measured 4 ft 2 in (1.27 m) with a 2 ft 10 in (86 cm) long tail, the largest being 4 ft 8 in (1.42 m) with a 3 ft 2 in (97 cm) long tail.
                          The Sri Lankan leopard has allegedly evolved to become a rather large leopard subspecies, because it is an apex predator without competition by other large wild cat species in the country.
                          Large males have been suggested to reach almost 220 lb (100 kg), but evidence for this is lacking.<br>
                          
                          
                          <br>The Junglefowl is the national bird of Srilanka.
                          The male Sri Lankan junglefowl ranges from 66–72 cm (26–28 in) in length and 790–1,140 g (1.74–2.51 lb) in weight, essentially resembling a large, muscular rooster. 
                          The male has orange-red body plumage, and dark purple to black wings and tail.
                          The feathers of the mane descending from head to base of spine are golden, and the face has bare red skin and wattles.
                          The comb is red with a yellow centre. 
                          As with the green junglefowl, the cock does not possess an eclipse plumage.
